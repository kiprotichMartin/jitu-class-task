/*========== TASK 1 ==========*/
Predefined functions - list & show usage


/*========== TASK 2 ==========*/
Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 and for multiples of ‘3’
  print “Fizz” instead of the number, for the multiples of ‘5’ print “Buzz” and
    print "FizzBuzz" for the numbers divisible by both 3 and 5. 


To manage this task you're supposed to incorporate conditional Logic, function
  definition and recursion (What we learnt today).


NB: Don't use loops.
